Run Exctract-Exchange_ISO.ps1 in order to download the Exchange ISO, extract the files, and zip them.

Once that's down run Install-Exchange.ps1 to spin up an Exchange server in Research.local and add it to the escalation path.

Please note that Research.local must be up & running before running Install-Exchange.ps1. You must run Create-Cousin.ps1 first.
